jms-test
========

Simple JMS test application.
Mainly for ease investigation into JMS setup with some containers
and WebSphere MQ.

Would be nice to get it working well, including XA transactions on
following platforms:

JBoss 4.0.5
JBoss 7.1
Tomcat 6

Requirement: no hardcoded configuration into deployable artifact.

All environment specific configuration needs to be externalized.
